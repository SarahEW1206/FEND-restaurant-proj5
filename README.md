# Resubmission notes
---
Thank you for your review! I realized that I failed to push my last round of updates before submitting, so my serviceworker will look quite different (and hopefully work now). :)

I was having trouble getting the more simplified SW code (i.e. the code we used in the course exercise) to work (even with correct cache name). It would cache, but not fetch any of the files.  I would love to figure out what hte issue was, but in the meantime, I found a different version online that works for me, and have credited the source accordingly for their help.  (Doug Brown: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92dtrNU1GQc)

Regarding the tab order: is there a way to remove the Map entirely? I tried putting tabindex of -1 in the section and div that contain the map but it didn't help.  WOULD you want to remove it? Or just set it up to come after the more important elements?

Thanks!
Sarah
